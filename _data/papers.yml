- name: Network Storage Analysis via Semiring Geometry
  description: We introduce a novel semiring model for contact-based routing protocols that includes a means of determining storage needs. Through proper analysis of the semiring structure, we show how to determine optimal storage structures in satellite networks. In addition, we run our analysis on simulated satellite networks to demonstrate the potential for working with these semiring models in a computational framework. We conclude by indicating future directions for semiring analysis is space communications.

- name: Applications of Generalized Universal Valuations
  description: We introduce a generalization of the universal valuation semiring defined by Jeffrey and Noah Giansiracusa. We then explicitly characterize the additive structure of this semiring and show that, when applied to \(\mathbb Q\), this characterization gives the Non-Archimedean case of Ostrowski's theorem. We conclude with examples of non-commutative valuations and their applications, such as the detection of the existence of representations of rings in ultrametric vector spaces.

- name: Algebraic and Geometric Models for Space Networking
  description: In this paper we introduce some new algebraic and geometric perspectives on networked space communications. Our main contribution is a novel definition of a time-varying graph (TVG), defined in terms of a matrix with values in subsets of the real line \(P(\mathbb R)\). We leverage semi-ring properties of \(P(\mathbb R)\) to model multi-hop communication in a TVG using matrix multiplication and a truncated Kleene star. This leads to novel statistics on the communication capacity of TVGs called lifetime curves, which we generate for large samples of randomly chosen STARLINK satellites, whose connectivity is modeled over day-long simulations. Determining when a large subsample of STARLINK is temporally strongly connected is further analyzed using novel metrics introduced here that are inspired by topological data analysis (TDA). To better model networking scenarios between the Earth and Mars, we introduce various semi-rings capable of modeling propagation delay as well as protocols common to Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN), such as store-and-forward. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of zigzag persistence for featurizing different space networks and demonstrate the efficacy of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification for distinguishing Earth-Mars and Earth-Moon satellite systems using time-varying topology alone.
